# QuestPatcherNative

QuestPatcherNative is a port for a GUI based mod installer for any il2cpp unity app on the Oculus Quest that runs on Windows, Linux or macOS.
It was originally created for modding Gorilla Tag.

It uses Sc2ad's [QuestLoader](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestLoader/) for loading mods and is based mostly on RedBrumbler's [CLI Tool](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestAppPatcher).

See `QuestPatcher.Core/Resources/qmod.schema.json` for the `mod.json` that QMODs must contain, alongside their mod files.
